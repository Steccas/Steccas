### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Luca Steccanella

I am a passionate CyberSecurity expert, SysAdmin and Network administrators.
I'm not a developer since I work way better with Operating Systems, Shells, Network appliances or SIEM but I use GitHub for various useful scripts or tool that I make for myself from time to time!
